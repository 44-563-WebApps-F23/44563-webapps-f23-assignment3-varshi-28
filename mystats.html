    <h1>My Self</h1>
    <p>Generally, I'm an introvert who values exploration over expression. While I cherish moments of quiet introspection, I'm also deeply passionate about two things: dogs and the serene beauty of nature. I'm a caninophile, which means I have an abiding love for dogs, and I'm equally a naturephile, captivated by the breathtaking allure of the natural world. These passions bring joy and wonder to my life.
    In terms of technical interests, I have a strong passion for HTML and aspire to become a web developer. Lately, I've also been captivated by Markdown and am eager to explore it further through experimentation.</p>
    
    <h2>My Favourite Food</h2>
    <p>
        Panipuri, with its burst of flavors and crispiness, is undeniably my all-time favorite food.
        Pani puri is a very popular street food in India, 
        The combination of flavors: Pani puri is a perfect blend of sweet, spicy, and tangy flavors. The puri is crispy and slightly sweet, the filling is savory and spicy, and the pani is tangy and refreshing.
